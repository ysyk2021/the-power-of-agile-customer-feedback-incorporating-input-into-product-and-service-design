Additionally, Apple regularly collects customer feedback through surveys, social media, and customer support interactions. This feedback is used to inform product updates and improvements.

The result of this customer-centric approach to product development is a loyal customer base and products that consistently receive high customer satisfaction ratings.

Airbnb is a company that has disrupted the hospitality industry by providing an alternative to traditional hotels. The company's success is due in part to its use of customer feedback to inform product development.

For example, Airbnb uses customer feedback to identify areas where hosts may need additional support or resources. The company also uses customer feedback to identify opportunities for improving the user experience, such as simplifying the booking process or enhancing the search functionality.

By using customer feedback to drive innovation and improve the user experience, Airbnb has become one of the most successful disruptors in the hospitality industry.
