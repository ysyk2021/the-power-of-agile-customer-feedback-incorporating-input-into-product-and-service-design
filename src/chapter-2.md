Definition of Agile Customer Feedback
-------------------------------------

Agile customer feedback is an approach to collecting and incorporating customer input into product and service design that emphasizes speed, flexibility, and collaboration. This approach is based on the principles of agile development, which prioritize iterative, collaborative, and customer-centric approaches to product development.

Agile customer feedback involves collecting feedback from customers early and often, and using that feedback to drive continuous improvement in product and service design. This approach places a premium on speed and flexibility, with a focus on rapidly incorporating customer feedback into each iteration of the product development process.

Benefits of Agile Customer Feedback

Here are some common myths about agile customer feedback:

### Myth #1: Agile customer feedback is only for software development

While agile customer feedback was originally developed for software development, it can be applied to any product or service development process. The key is to prioritize customer feedback and to use an iterative, collaborative approach to product development.
